ADIL KHAN - Foundation University C++ Project

Overview
This C++ program demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and console graphics to display a name and university name using asterisk (*) patterns. 
It uses cursor positioning through the `gotoxy()` function and introduces basic animation using `Sleep()` for smooth letter drawing.

Features
1. Displays the name "ADIL KHAN" in asterisk pattern.
2. Displays "FOUNDATION UNIVERSITY" below it.
3. Uses cursor movement (gotoxy) for proper alignment.
4. Includes small animation delays for better visual presentation.

How to Run
1. Make sure `gotoxy.h` is in the same directory as this `.cpp` file.
2. Compile and run the program in a Windows-based C++ environment.
3. The console will display the name and university name in animated star patterns.
